# Mathcha-Keyboard-Shortcuts
This script is meant to add more hotkey functions to Mathcha. If you are someone who is disabled and uses Mathcha, please reach out to me, and I'll add hotkeys to better suit your needs.

To see the website it is intended for, go to https://www.mathcha.io

Please note that this project is still under development, and hotkeys will be added as I feel needed.
