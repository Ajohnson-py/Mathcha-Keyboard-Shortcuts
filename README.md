# Mathcha-Keyboard-Shortcuts
This script is meant to add more hotkey functions to Mathcha. If you are someone who is disabled and uses Mathcha, please reach out to me, and I'll add hotkeys to better suit your needs.

My email is augustjohnson.py@gmail.com

To see the website it is intended for, go to https://www.mathcha.io

Please note that this project is still under development, and hotkeys will be added as I feel needed.

Shortcuts currently added:
1. control + b (makes whatever you type bold)
2. control + v (makes whatever you type have vector notation)
3. control + m (creates a determinant for finding the cross product of 2 vectors)
4. control + f (creates a function or the partial derivative of a function with the specified number of variables, 3 max)

How to use each shortcut:

control + b:
After pressing control + b, type what you want to be bold and then hit enter.

control + v:
After pressing control + v, type what you want to be a vector and then hit enter.

control + m:
After pressing control + m, a determinant will be created with i, j, and k on the top row. After it is created, fill it in.

control + f:
After pressing control + f, type x or y depending on what you want to do the partial derivative with respect to then type 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the number of variables the function is dependant on. To just create a regular function, type the number of variables the function is dependant on.
